# Top Posts from Facebook by Trending Authors
Proof of concept for a module that leverages the Parse.ly API to display the top five authors of the past 24 hours based on interactions across various social media platforms. This module also links to the top article from each author as measured by referrals from Facebook.

## How to view results
1. Clone the git repository to your local environment
2. Add the secret key to the `config.js` file
3. Open `index.html` in your browser

*This module was created specifically for nola.com as part of an interview coding challenge, but should work for all Parse.ly subscribers. Provide the appropriate API key and secret in the `config.js` file*
