# parsely-trending-authors

## Description
Proof of concept for a module that leverages the [Parse.ly API](https://www.parse.ly/help/api) to display the **top five authors of the past 24 hours** based on interactions across social media platforms and **links to the top article from each author** as measured by referrals from Facebook.

## How to view results
1. Clone the git repository to your local environment
2. Add the secret key to the `config.js` file
3. Open `index.html` in your browser

*This module was created specifically for [nola.com](https://www.nola.com/) as part of an interview coding challenge, but should work for all Parse.ly subscribers. Provide the appropriate API key and secret in the `config.js` file*
